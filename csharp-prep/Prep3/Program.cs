        Overview
        In the Guess My Number game the computer picks a magic number, and then the user tries to guess it. 
        After each guess, the computer tells the user to guess "higher" or "lower" until they guess the magic number.
        This assignment is a little tricky, because it brings together many of the concepts you've learned in 
        this course including loops and if statements.
